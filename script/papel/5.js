        "W: Don’t be discouraged. Now a new study suggests getting benefits from exercise doesn’t have to be that demanding. Jacob Sattelmair from Harvard University has done a study into how much exercise is needed to lower the risk of heart attacks.",
        "M: Mmm…, interesting!",
        "W: The study showed that people who put in 300 minutes a week of exercise had a 20% lower risk of death due to heart disease. Still, the people who exercise 115 minutes a week did pretty well, too, lowering their death risk by 14%.",
        "M: And what about the people who exercise half as much as that, like what I probably do? Does that help?",
        "W: Of course, even 15 minutes would help.",
